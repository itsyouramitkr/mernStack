🔐 1. User Logs In
You check if the user is valid (by email/password).

Then you generate a JWT token like this:

const data = {
  user: {
    id: user.id  // user._id from the MongoDB "users" collection
  }
};
const token = jwt.sign(data, JWT_SECRET);
✅ This token contains only the user's ID (no name, no email, etc.).

✅ This token is sent to the frontend (client).

📥 2. Frontend Stores and Sends the Token
The frontend stores the token (usually in localStorage).

Then it sends the token in the request headers when making protected API calls.


GET /api/notes/fetchNotes
Headers:
  auth_token: <your_JWT_token>
🔍 3. Backend Middleware (fetchuser) Runs
This middleware does:


const data = jwt.verify(token, JWT_SECRET);
req.user = data.user; // Now req.user = { id: 'MongoDB_user_id' }
✅ This makes the user ID available for the next route.

📝 4. Creating a Note

await Notes.create({
  title: req.body.title,
  description: req.body.description,
  user: req.user.id  // This links the note to the logged-in user
});
✅ The note is saved with user: ObjectId(...) — i.e., the user's MongoDB _id.

📤 5. Fetching Notes (e.g., /api/notes/fetchNotes)

const notes = await Notes.find({ user: req.user.id });
res.json(notes);
✅ This gives only the notes where user matches the logged-in user’s ID (from the token).

✅ Final Summary (in your words + polished):
When a user logs in, a token is generated that stores only their MongoDB _id. 
This ID is decoded from the token in future API calls using middleware.
When creating a note, this ID is stored in the user field of the note. 
Later, when fetching notes, the backend uses this ID to find and return 
only the notes that belong to that specific user.


////////////////////////////
Step	                             What happens
User logs in	                Token is generated with user's Mongo _id
Token is sent in header         Middleware decodes it and sets req.user.id
Route fetches notes	            Notes.find({ user: req.user.id }) — finds notes linked to the user
Result	                        You get all notes created by that specific user


///// this is the what i understand

when create the user by default id is generated
    _id: ObjectId('6870adfbb61dfba27a8dbeae'),
like this 
when we login we create a token inside token i have passed the user:{req.id} when user want 
to fetch the his own data he use token to verify to verify with    _id: ObjectId('6870adfbb61dfba27a8dbeae'),
same id right.
and it will get the his data (user);

now to find the which user have their notes
in this we created the notes with field title,description and tag and user:req.user.id => will the user id form he user collection that is     _id: ObjectId('686f9344952fb40bedde90f0'),
right  and it get stored in the database like   user: ObjectId('686f9344952fb40bedde90f0'),

now when we fetchnotes it will first go the middleware(fetchuser)
in this token id is stored it will match with id _id: ObjectId('686f9344952fb40bedde90f0'),
from the user collection and noe move to next() it will go the async here Notes.find(user:req.user.id) will get from the user: ObjectId('686f9344952fb40bedde90f0')
or the _id: ObjectId('686f9344952fb40bedde90f0'),
to fetch the notesdata
